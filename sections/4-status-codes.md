The default response to anything I ask my daughter.
I talked about this earlier in the talk.

> "Hi angel, can you clean up your room? It looks like a pig stye in there."
> "Well, technically pigs have pointy ears and a curly tail. I have neither of those things, so no, I won't clean up my room."

> "Hi angel, please turn off the TV, you've been watching for over an hour already and we both know that 30 minutes is the limit."
> "Well, technically I watched for 45 minutes yesterday, and you didn't complain about it then. So no, I won't turn off the TV."

Basically, she'll find some loophole in my question that warrants her to dismiss it in its entirety.
It makes me think of legal TV series like ‚ÄúSuits‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Lincoln Lawyer‚Äù where a mistrial is pronounced whenever a tiny detail in the process is off.
So the request isn‚Äôt rejected because it‚Äôs impossible to fulfill, but because of a perceived flaw in the _formulation_ of the request itself. 
My teenage kids are actively dissecting and deconstructing my request to escape responsibility.

## 401 vs. 403

<span class="monospaced">401 Unauthorized</span> means "You need to log in first",
which makes it an <em>identity issue</em>.

<p class="fragment">
    <span class="monospaced">403 Forbidden</span> means "You're logged in, but you're not allowed to do that",
    which makes it a <em>permission issue</em>.

note:
The default response to anything I ask my son.
I talked about this earlier in the talk.

> Dad: *asks kid to do a chore*
> Kid: (‚Ä¶)
> Dad: ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù
> Kid: (‚Ä¶)
> Dad (getting impatient): ‚ÄúHellooo?! Earth to kid?!‚Äù
> Kid: "What? I didn't hear you..."

Because if you don't answer, you may just get off the hook!

note:
Dad: ‚ÄúTime to get up, kid. You've got school in 45 minutes.‚Äù.
Teenager: ‚Äù(...)&nbsp;&nbsp;üò¥" *feigned sleeping*
But if he was able to talk, he'd say: "I don't know how to do that."

Absolute non-compliance, often accompanied by feigned sleep or a complete lack of acknowledgement. The functionality (waking up early) is simply not implemented in their operating system.

Usage Tips: probably never use, as this status code is only appropriate when the HTTP method is unknown (PARTY request)

note:
"Dad! Can't you see I'm busy?"
An abrupt dismissal, often with no indication of _what_ they‚Äôre busy with (but probably with their phone).
