<h1>👦🏼<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">&nbsp;&nbsp;🛹</span><span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;🙂‍↔️</span></h1>
<h1>👧🏽<span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;💄</span><span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;🙂‍↔️</span></h1>

note:
These are my teenage kids.
They like teenage things, like (slide) skateboarding, (slide) trying out new makeup combinations and (slide) basically not doing anything I ask them!
Is it just me, or do more parents have this experience? Any parents in the room? ✋

Before we continue, I just want to make clear that I love my kids to bits, okay?
As a parent I don't think you can resent your kids for acting teenagey.
Goodness knows I have acted in a similar way in the past.

So rest assured, I didn't create this talk just to get back at them.
I created it so you lot can sympathize with me (or laugh at me, whichever you prefer)
And to put my kids' teen-like responses to my questions to good use.
Let me give a few examples of the conversations I'm talking about.

<div class="grid">
    <div class="header right-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="1" style="font-size: 2em">👨🏼</div>
    <div class="span-3 left-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="1">"Hi son, it's your turn to do the dishes today."</div>
    <div class="span-3 right-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="2">"(...)"</div>
    <div class="header left-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="2" style="font-size: 2em">👦🏼</div>
    <div class="header right-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="3" style="font-size: 2em">👨🏼</div>
    <div class="span-3 left-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="3">"Hello? Can you please do the dishes?"</div>
    <div class="span-3 right-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="4">"(...)"</div>
    <div class="header left-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="4" style="font-size: 2em">👦🏼</div>
    <div class="header right-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="5" style="font-size: 2em">👨🏼</div>
    <div class="span-3 left-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="5">"Hellooo?! Earth to kid? The dishes!"</div>
    <div class="span-3 right-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="6">"What? I didn't hear you..."</div>
    <div class="header left-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="6" style="font-size: 2em">👦🏼</div>
</div>

note:
Because if you don't answer, you may just get off the hook!

<div class="grid">
    <div class="span-3 right-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="1"><span class="monospaced">500 Internal Server Error</span></div>
    <div class="header left-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="1" style="font-size: 2em">👦🏼</div>
</div>

note:
Is it just me, or does this conversation remind me an awful lot of (slide) HTTP status code 500?

<div class="grid">
    <div class="header right-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="1" style="font-size: 2em">👨🏼</div>
    <div class="span-3 left-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="1">"Hi angel, can you please clean up your room? It looks like a pig stye in there."</div>
    <div class="span-3 right-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="2">"Well, technically pigs have pointy ears and a curly tail. I have neither of those things, so no, I won't clean up my room."</div>
    <div class="header left-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="2" style="font-size: 2em">👧🏽</div>
    <div class="header right-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="3" style="font-size: 2em">👨🏼</div>
    <div class="span-3 left-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="3">"Hi angel, please turn off the TV, you've been watching for over an hour already and we both know that 30 minutes is the limit."</div>
    <div class="span-3 right-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="4">"Well, technically I watched for 45 minutes yesterday, and you didn't complain about it then. So why turn it off now?"</div>
    <div class="header left-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="4" style="font-size: 2em">👧🏽</div>
</div>

<div class="grid">
    <div class="span-3 right-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="1"><span class="monospaced">400 Bad Request</span></div>
    <div class="header left-aligned fragment" data-fragment-index="1" style="font-size: 2em">👧🏽</div>
</div>

note:
Is it just me, or does these conversations remind me of (slide) HTTP status code 400?

My daughter basically finds some loophole in my question that warrants her to dismiss it in its entirety.
It makes me think of legal TV series like “Suits” or “The Lincoln Lawyer” where a mistrial is pronounced whenever a tiny detail in the process is off.
So the request isn’t rejected because it’s impossible to fulfill, but because of a perceived flaw in the _formulation_ of the request itself. 
My daughter seems to be actively dissecting and deconstructing my request to escape responsibility.

note:
So, the way my teenage kids talk to me makes me think of HTTP status codes.
Let's decode the languange that modern software systems use to communicate by relating a set of prominent status codes to an appropriate teenage response.
And I'll make sure to include a few do's and don't's for every status code we go through, whether you're a developer, tester, architect or data engineer.
Sound good?
