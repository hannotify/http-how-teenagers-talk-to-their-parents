note:
1. though that is a very good word too, and one that the Dutch have become famous for
2. And one that everyone knows since President Obama visited the city of The Hague in 2014 and thought his visit was 'truly gezellig'
3. But I'm talking about a different word

note:
1. BEROEPSDEFORMATIE
2. Other languages have a similar word (slide x5), but oddly enough English isn't one of them
3. There *is* an English Wikipedia page on the subject, but funnily enough (slide) it uses the French word instead of an English equivalent.
4. Which further leads me to believe that an English equivalent simply doesn't exist.
5. So let's see a definition, for those of you who aren't fluent in Dutch, French, German, Italian, Swedish or Spanish.

## 'beroepsdeformatie' is...

> "a quirk, trait or habit caused by one's occupation"
